# Gitlet
Miniature Version of the Git Version Control System

This project was created as a part of CS61B: Data Structures at UC Berkeley. It is essentially a smaller version of the Git system encompassing many of the same
features such as adding, committing, branching, merging, and checking out. The implementation utilizes a Serializable interface that incorporates a SHA-1 scheme as 
the cryptographic hash function.
